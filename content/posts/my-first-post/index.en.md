# Motivation
Welcome! This is my first post on this blog. The main goal of this website is to store materials that could be useful for programmers, DevOps, and SecOps engineers.

# Technology
In my daily work, I focus on setting up infrastructure (especially databases) using Kubernetes and Terraform. Therefore, my future posts will be related to these technologies.

# Warnings
While my English is far from perfect, I will strive to make my posts as clear and comprehensible as possible.
